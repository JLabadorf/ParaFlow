Let's refine your research paper section by section, paragraph by paragraph, focusing on clarity, argumentation, logical flow, and proper citations. I'll provide feedback and suggestions to help you strengthen each part.

Step 1: Section Selection and Input

To begin, tell me which section of your research paper you'd like to edit. Common sections include:

- Introduction
- Literature Review
- Methodology
- Results/Findings
- Discussion
- Conclusion

Or specify another section if your paper has different headings

Once you select a section, please paste the entire text of that section below. This will allow me to understand the context of each paragraph as we work through them.
